# Midtrans Payment Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to integrate Midtrans payment gateway into the Azrafqueen Store application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Checkout Form (`src/lib/checkout-schemas.ts`)
- Added "midtrans" as a valid payment method option
- Added "Credit/Debit Card" payment option to the payment methods list with appropriate icon and description

### 2. Updated Orders API (`src/app/api/orders/route.ts`)
- Integrated Midtrans Snap client library
- Added logic to create Midtrans Snap transactions for orders with "midtrans" payment method
- Included customer and item details in Midtrans transaction parameters
- Return Snap redirect URL in the API response for Midtrans payments

### 3. Updated Checkout Page (`src/app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- Modified form submission to redirect to Midtrans payment page when "midtrans" payment method is selected
- Maintains existing behavior for other payment methods

### 4. Updated Order Confirmation Page (`src/app/order-confirmation/[orderNumber]/page.tsx`)
- Added payment instructions section for Midtrans payments
- Includes a retry payment button for cases where automatic redirect didn't work

### 5. Enhanced Webhook Handler (`src/app/api/webhooks/midtrans/route.ts`)
- Improved payment method update logic to preserve existing Midtrans payment method naming

## How It Works

1. Customer selects "Credit/Debit Card" payment option during checkout
2. Order is created in the database with PENDING status
3. Midtrans Snap transaction is created with order details
4. Customer is redirected to Midtrans payment page to complete payment
5. Midtrans sends webhook notifications to update order payment status
6. Customer is redirected back to order confirmation page

## Environment Variables Required
The following environment variables must be set in `.env`:
- `MIDTRANS_SERVER_KEY` - Your Midtrans server key
- `MIDTRANS_CLIENT_KEY` - Your Midtrans client key
- `MIDTRANS_IS_PRODUCTION` - Set to "true" for production, "false" for sandbox

## Testing
To test the integration:
1. Ensure environment variables are properly configured
2. Select "Credit/Debit Card" during checkout
3. Verify redirection to Midtrans payment page
4. Complete a test payment using Midtrans sandbox
5. Check that order status updates correctly via webhook

## Notes
- The integration uses Midtrans Snap API for a seamless payment experience
- Webhook handling is already implemented to receive payment status updates
- Error handling is included to ensure orders are created even if Midtrans API fails
